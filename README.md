Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the art of scienceof designing ,  building and maintaining software solutions that solve real-world problems.
importance in thechnology industry 
1.enhancing effficiency 
2. supporting scalability
3. ensuring quality and reliability

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The birth of software Engineering (1968) - The term was first introduced at a NATO conference to address the software crisis caused by poor development practices.
2. The advent of structured programming (1970s) - introduced methodologies like modular programming to imptove code organization and maintainablility.
3. The rise of Agile methodologies(2001) - The agile manifesto was published ,  promoting iterative development ,collaboration and flexibility in software projects.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Analysis phase - the problem statement is developed.
2. Design phase - creating software architecture ,UI/UX design and system blueprints.
3. implementation phase - writing cose based on the design specifications .

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology : Suitable for large projects with fixed requirements,there is minimal client involvement until deployment, sequential based and difficult to accomodate.

Agile methodology: ideal for projects with evolving needs, there is continuous client involvement ,iterative based and easy to adapt .

examples 
Waterfall: a banking system where strict regulatory compliance ia required.
Agile: A new e-commerce website where user feedback is constantly incoporated .


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software developer
   . writes and maintains code following best practices
   . develops new features and fixes bugs
   . collaborates with designers , testers and other developers
2. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
   . developes and executes test cases.
   . identifies and reports software defects.
   . ensures sotware meets prformance , security and usability standards.
3. Project manager
   . oversees project timelines , budgets and scope.
   . Facilitates communication between stakeholders.
   .manages risk and resolves conflicys within the team .    


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments(IDEs) provide tools for coding , debugging and testing in one platform.
example : Visual Studio Code 
version control systems(VCS) track code changes , enable collaboration and support rollback to previous versions 
exampe : Git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Meeting tight deadlines - follow Agile sprints , prioritize tasks and breakdown work into manageable chunks.
keeping up with evolving technologies - engage in continuos learning through courses and open source contributions 
Handling team communication - utilize tools like slack ,jira and GitHub for effective collaboration 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit Testing - Test individual components or functions to ensure they work as expected .
integration testing - ensures that different modules of the software work together correctly ,
system testing - verifies that the complete software system meets reguirements .
Acceptance testing - conducted with end -users to confirm the software meets requrements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements  to get the best possible responses from AI models.
importance 
1.Enhances response quality 
2. Reduces Ambiguity 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt : Tell me about history 
improved Prompt: Explain the key events that led to kenya's independence in 1963 and discuss how they shaped the country's political landscape 
why the improved prompt is more effective 
1.consise but detailed 
2. it is clear 
3. it is more specific
